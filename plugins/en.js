  welcomeMsg: `Hi, my name is Jeffrey Ernst and I welcome you to CreativeFLUX where I present myself,
   showcase some of my work and offer current and (potential) future clients an insight in what they
   can expect when working with me.`,
  aboutHeader: `About me`,
  aboutMsg: `Originally trained as a biologist (Msc. in 2010), I found software as a profession at a later age
   while doing research and using programming to help me automate processes in data
   analytics (2014). Eventually this side-activity took hold of me and became a passion. It is from there 
   that I chose to pursue a career in software and I haven't looked back since.`,
  aboutMsg2: `For me programming is a mechanism of creative expression which I like to do besides painting and illustration.
   I like to work on 'beautifull' products that catch the users attention either by the direct satisfaction it
   brings them (like games and AV apps) or by making life a little easier through great UX, better technology or availability.
   I enjoy working with new technology and experimenting with technologies and frameworks that are on the bleeding edge. It
   is through this I've build a broad knowledge base with back-end technologies like: Java 7/8 J2EE, Node Express, Node Restify,
   Python Django and Python Flask as well as Front-end technologies like: VueJS, AngularJS, ReactJS, Vanilla ES2015+.`,
  aboutMsg3: `As a person I enjoy collaboration and teamwork, thinking things through and planning out a task before hand.
   I am known for my large base of Trivia knowledge, ability of being a bridge between bussiness and technology, and my oversight.
   This last quality is what usually leads to me having some kind of lead role in a team or at least being included in the more
   complex stories with regards to architecture.`,
  aboutMsg4: `Privately I have twin daughter and son. I enjoy (board)games with friends, painting, pursuing historical or
   scientific knowledge. Building things, scuba diving and if there is still time left in a day I enjoy a good movie.`
